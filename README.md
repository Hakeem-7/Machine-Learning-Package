# Final_Project_Group_5

The goal of this project is to develop an R package that implements a foundational machine learning algorithm - linear regression. The scope of the package includes producing outputs such as statistical confidence intervals (C.I) at the user selected significance level and method of solution. The two method of solution available in the developed package are the asymptotic and the bootstrap.
