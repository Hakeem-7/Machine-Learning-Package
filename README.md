# Final_Project_Group_5

The goal of this project is to develop an R package that implements linear regression. The scope of the package includes producing outputs such as statistical confidence intervals (C.I) at the user selected significance level (i.e. `\alpha`) and method of solution. The two method of solution available in the package are the asymptotic and the bootstrap.
